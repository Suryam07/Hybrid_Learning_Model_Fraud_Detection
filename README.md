# Hybrid_Learning_Model_Fraud_Detection
This repository contains hybrid machine learning models designed to detect illicit cryptocurrency transactions using the Elliptic Bitcoin dataset. By combining traditional classifiers with deep learning architectures, our approach enhances accuracy and reduces false positives in AML/CFT applications.
